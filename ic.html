            <h2> What is Infinity closet?</h2>
            <p> Infinity closet is a monthly subscription service that allows users to keep their wardrobe fresh without the price tag. With Infinity Closet, you are able to rent clothes and accessories for any occasion with the option to buy. With
               Infinity Closet your closet has no limits.
            </p>
            <h2> Objective</h2>
            <p> Clothing rental service for every occasion & for every gender.</p>
            <h2> My role </h2>
            <p> UI + UX Designer; I conducted competitor research, created user flows, wireframing, prototyping and user testing.</p>
            <h2>Design Process</h2>
            <p>User-Centered Design was employed by using the Jobs to Be Done framework to focus on the users needs, user flow and success criteria. From these flows, a low fidelity prototype was created. iOS and Material Design guidelines were followed
               that helped to clearly define typographic hierarchy, use of color and to make sure consistent UI Design was applied across all screens.

            <h2>User Problem</h2>
            <p>There is a lack of clothing subscription service in the market that include everyday casual clothing options, formal options, AND accessories. Not only that, but there is a lack of male gendered clothing rental services as well servies that
               include non-bianary/unisex options.
            </p>
            <h2> Competitive Analysis</h2>
            <p>Competitive Analysis was performed on 3 popular clothing rental apps. The main features studied were: </p>
            <ol>
               <li> What is the onboarding process and way in which the apps curate their selection of items for the user?</li>
               <li> Do the apps have accessory rental options?</li>
               <li>Do the apps have other gendered clothing options outside of female? </li>
            </ol>
            <p> Out of the three, only 1 of the apps had a style quiz, 1 of the apps had options for accessory rentals and 1 app had neither. All three of the apps did not have male and non-bianary clothing rental options</p>
            <h2> Hypothesis </h2>
            <p> With clothing rental apps on the rise, users would like to seek an app with additional options such as accessory rentals as well as the option to rent different gendered clothing.</p>
            <h2> Jobs to be done  </h2>
            <p> After completing competitive analysis, the Jobs to Be Done perspective was applied to find the focus of the user’s needs and flows.</p>
            <h3> Flow 1 </h3>
            <p>When I plan for the coming weeks, I want to browse items available so I can save items I like to “my closet” and potentially add to my cart to check out </p>
            <h3> Flow 2</h3>
            <p> When I have my items at home I like, I want to be able to purchase the item so I can own it forever</p>
            <h3> Flow 3</h3>
            <p>When I’m searching through clothes available, I want to be able to search for clothes for a different gender, so I can have access to more options both in my order </p>
            <h2> Low-Fidelity + Mid-Fidelity Wireframes </h2>
            <p> After completing the flow chart the low-fidelity wireframes were thought out and created. From low-fidelity any potential issues were ironed out and the mid-fidelity wireframes were created </p>

            <h2> User testing </h2>
            <p> The mid-fidelty wireframes were tested on users who were asked to sign up with infinity closet and save an item to their closet</p>
